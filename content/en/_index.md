      ## My Story

      In 2009 my hard work in javelin throw paid off when I joined Boise State University Broncos track and field team. At the same time I was enrolled in Communication studies and began exploration in the complexity of our social structures.


      In the course of my Master's studies, we held a shared seminar class with the University of Social Sciences in Ljubljana with our professor as a visiting lecturer there. At that point, I knew I had met my mentor for life, so to speak. It was that same year in 2014 when I graduated with an M.A. in Communication Studies that for the first time I realized through a series of events how we can be at a different part of the world, but somehow connected at the same time.


      Since my graduation, I was guided by the wish of helping people and quickly found myself working in the nonprofit world. I worked in the field of fundraising, marketing, initial resettlement services and advising individuals entering their professional fields. Throughout this time, I participated in young profesisonals development program in the local chamber of commerce.


      After ten years of living abroad, I felt it was time to return home. This made me more aware and notice nuances of the cultural differences between the two continents. It made me recognize the high quality of life that is provided to us by Slovenian small businesses and farmers. With this came the realization that I would like to transfer the knowledge and skills gained abroad in the development of Slovenian products and encourage self-promotion.


      From this stemmed the idea of a company "Na net," to encourage stories of Slovenian providers to launch their stories and position themselves with digital content.

      ## How do we start?

      We all have something in us that makes us special, I’m sure of it. Sometimes, however, it is easier for us to recognize good virtues in others. I find them again and again in the top quality providers whose story is still waiting to be presented to the world.

      I will guide you through a strucutred process to discover your story, the one that highlights your strengths and makes you stand out in the crowd.

Upoštevala je moje želje ob tem pa s svojimi idejami in vizijo naredila stran pregledno in moderno. Zares najboljša izbira, če niste prepričani kako predstaviti in približati svoj izdelek svetu. Saša je zanesljiva, zagnana in s pozitivnim odnosom do dela vedno predstavi in najde še kakšno rešitev za moje projekte. Priporočam vsem, ki vrjamejo v sveže in nove ideje s katerimi Saša vedno znova preseneti.
